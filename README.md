#  Adonay

**Adonay** is a ritual terminal for emotional truth.

This Rust-based CLI tool lets you log your current mood and receive a corresponding ritual or creative command. Each entry becomes a timestamped offering‚Äîa quiet record of becoming.

Adonay isn‚Äôt productivity software. It‚Äôs a witness.

## Features

- üåÄ Input how you feel in the moment
- üåÄ Receive a mood-aligned ritual or prompt
- üåÄ Log entries in a simple, timestamped journal
- üåÄ Optionally define your own moods and ritual mappings

## Philosophy

Adonay is built on the principle of **intentional software**.  
Rather than solving problems, it enables *expression* of emotional and symbolic states. It‚Äôs a tool for internal alignment, not external efficiency.

##  Intentional Programming + Adonay

###  What Is Intentional Programming?

At its heart, intentional programming separates **what you mean** (your *intention*) from **how it‚Äôs executed** in code. It enables:
- **Declarative input**
- **Editable semantic meaning**
- **User-defined logic layered over shared systems**

### How We Integrate It Into Adonay

| Layer | Example | Implementation Idea |
|-------|---------|----------------------|
| **User Intent Language** | `feel "foggy"` or `invoke drift` | A DSL (domain-specific language) for moods |
| **Mood-to-Ritual Map** | `"foggy" => "walk alone for 20 mins"` | Stored in editable TOML or JSON |
| **Contextual Invocation** | Mood logs tie to time, season, or phase | `log_entry` struct holds timestamp, moon phase (future) |
| **Semantic Logging** | Not raw text, but expressive fields | `Mood`, `Resonance`, `Ritual`, `Reflection` |
| **Editable Definitions** | Users define what moods and rituals mean to them | External config or pluginable formats |

---

## Future Possibilities

- Build an **intent language parser** (like: `today: hazy, directionless ‚Üí seek solitude`)
- Introduce **templated mood archetypes** (e.g. `mystic`, `burned out`, `inspired`)
- Create a UI that shows **intention traces**: a log of what you felt and how you chose to respond
